# AI-Pacman
This is my solution to the Berkeley AI Pacman Project 1.

https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project1.html

In this project, the Pacman agent finds paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I was asked to built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

The only files I edited are:

    search.py	
, where all of the search algorithms reside and

    searchAgents.py	
, where all of the search-based agents reside.
